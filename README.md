# Data manipulation with pandas assignments

## What have we learnt so far?
* Understand the need for Pandas in Data Science
* Data Manipulation and Transformations
* Pivot Tables and Group By
* Merging Data

## Why solve complete this project?

This project challenges you to manipulate large datasets without using conventional programming 
techniques to extract business insights. Solving these assignments will help you get hands-on experience
of pandas library and help to develop a strong base for more complex data manipulations.
You will become proficient with the power-tool of pandas - the DataFrame.

## About the dataset
